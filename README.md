### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Mitchell, a young man with a passion for programming and a dream to become a game developer. Welcome to my world of creativity and innovation! Here, you'll find a collection of projects showcasing my journey as a developer, from tackling challenges in API integration to analysing LEGO datatsets and even exploring the realm of automated scheduling.

As I continue to learn and grow, I invite you to explore my portfolio and dive into the code behind each project on GitHub. Join me on my adventure as I strive to turn my game development dreams into reality, one line of code at a time.

Thank you for visiting my world, and I hope you enjoy your stay!
